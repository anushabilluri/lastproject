# lastproject
My idea with this website was to develop a e-commerce site that can be easily customized and added to by the user. The site boasts all the features that you would expect from a e-commerce site including product pages, product view pages, a shopping cart.
- This project is a simple ecommerce jewellery selling website which allows users to log in and sign up and also it allows the user to add products to the cart and checkout
-  Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart
-  user can check out product using paypal account
-  user can sign up and create membership
-  user can click forgot password and can create new one if in case he forgot his password by giving and verifying his email id associated to account
-  user can login to account by giving mail id and password
