#jewellery project

My idea with this website was to develop a e-commerce site that can be easily customized and added to by the user. The site boasts all the features that you would expect from a e-commerce site including product pages, product view pages, a shopping cart.
- This project is a simple ecommerce jewellery selling website which allows users to log in and sign up and also it allows the user to add products to the cart and checkout
-  Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart
-  user can check out product using paypal account
-  user can sign up and create membership
-  user can click forgot password and can create new one if in case he forgot his password by giving and verifying his email id associated to account
-  user can login to account by giving mail id and password
- below is front and backend which i used to develop this website
# Entities
***
-The entities of this e-commerce website can be broken down into three categories: products,customers,sellers.

-Products are the items that are sold on the website. Sellers are the businesses or individuals who sell these products. Customers are the people who buy the products.

-Each of these categories has its own set of entities. For example, products have their own set of attributes (e.g., name, price, description), sellers have their own set of contact information (e.g., address, phone number), and customers have their own set of purchase information (e.g., credit card number, shipping address).
